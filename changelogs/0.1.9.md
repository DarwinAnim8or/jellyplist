# Whats up in Jellyplist 0.1.9?
## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: docker-compose.yml
>![WARNING]
>In this release I´ve done some rework so now the setup is a bit easier, because you don´t have to spin up the -worker -beat container, these are now all in the default container and managed via supervisor. This means you have to update your `docker-compose.yml` when updating! 

So now your compose file should look more or less like this

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: redis
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
    networks:
      - jellyplist-network
  postgres:
    container_name: postgres-jellyplist
    image: postgres:17.2
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
      PGDATA: /data/postgres
    volumes:
       - /jellyplist_pgdata/postgres:/data/postgres
    networks:
      - jellyplist-network
    restart: unless-stopped
  
  jellyplist:
    container_name: jellyplist
    image: ${IMAGE}
    depends_on: 
      - postgres
      - redis
    ports:
      - "5055:5055"
    networks:
      - jellyplist-network
    volumes:
      - /jellyplist/cookies.txt:/jellyplist/cookies.txt
      - /jellyplist/open.spotify.com_cookies.txt:/jellyplist/spotify-cookie.txt
      - ${MUSIC_STORAGE_BASE_PATH}:${MUSIC_STORAGE_BASE_PATH}
    env_file:
      - .env

networks:
  jellyplist-network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
    postgres:
    redis_data:
```
And the `.env` File
```env
IMAGE = ghcr.io/kamilkosek/jellyplist:latest
POSTGRES_USER = jellyplist
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = jellyplist
SECRET_KEY = supersecretkey  # Secret key for session management
JELLYFIN_SERVER_URL = http://<jellyfin_server>:8096  # Default to local Jellyfin server
JELLYFIN_ACCESS_TOKEN = <jellyfin access token>
JELLYFIN_ADMIN_USER = <jellyfin admin username>
JELLYFIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD = <jellyfin admin password>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = <spotify client id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = <spotify client secret>
JELLYPLIST_DB_HOST = postgres-jellyplist
JELLYPLIST_DB_USER = jellyplist
JELLYPLIST_DB_PASSWORD = jellyplist
LOG_LEVEL = INFO
LIDARR_API_KEY = <lidarr api key>
LIDARR_URL = http://<lidarr server>:8686
LIDARR_MONITOR_ARTISTS = false
SPOTIFY_COOKIE_FILE = '/jellyplist/spotify-cookie.txt'
MUSIC_STORAGE_BASE_PATH = '/storage/media/music'

``` 
### 🆕 Log Viewer
Under the `Admin`  Page there is now a tab called `Logs` from where you can view the current logs, change the log-level on demand and copy a prepared markdown snippet ready to be pasted into a GitHub issue. 

### 🆕 New env var´s, a bit more control over spotDL
#### `SPOTDL_PROXY` 
Set a Proxy for spotDL. See [https://spotdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#command-line-options](https://spotdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#command-line-options)
#### `SPOTDL_OUTPUT_FORMAT`
Set the output folder and file name format for downloaded tracks via spotDL. Not all variables, which are supported by spotDL are supported by Jellyplist. 
- `{title}`
- `{artist}`
- `{artists}`
- `{album}`

This way you will have a bit more controler over how the files are stored. 
The complete output path is joined from `MUSIC_STORAGE_BASE_PATH` and `SPOTDL_OUTPUT_FORMAT`
