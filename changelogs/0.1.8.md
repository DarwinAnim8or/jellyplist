# Whats up in Jellyplist 0.1.8?
Not much this time, just some small fixes and one enhancement.

### ðŸ†•Jellyplist now checks for updates
Jellyplist now checks the GitHub releases for new version. 
If a new version is available, you will notice the small badge on the lower left will pulsate slighty, so you donÂ´t miss any new release :smile:

If you donÂ´t like that Jellyplist is doing this, you can opt out by setting this env var in your `.env` file
```bash
CHECK_FOR_UPDATES = false
```

### Other changes, improvements and fixes
- Fix for #30 , where the output path for spotDL wasnÂ´t created correctly
